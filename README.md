# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves building a **Linear Regression Model** to predict healthcare costs based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The model is trained and evaluated to achieve a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of under 3500**, ensuring accurate cost predictions.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- **Dataset Splitting**: Using **80% for training** and **20% for testing**.
- **Model Training**: Implementing Linear Regression using **TensorFlow/Keras or Scikit-Learn**.
- **Evaluation**: Checking model performance with **MAE** and visualizing results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 📉
- TensorFlow/Keras (Optional) 🧠

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features affecting healthcare costs:
- **Age**: Age of the person.
- **Sex**: Gender of the person (Male/Female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **Children**: Number of dependent children.
- **Smoker**: Whether the person smokes (Yes/No).
- **Region**: Geographic region (Northeast, Northwest, etc.).
- **Expenses**: The actual medical expenses (Target Variable).

## 🔧 How to Run the Project
1. Open **Google Colab** and upload the dataset.
2. Run the notebook cells step by step.
3. Train the model on 80% of the data.
4. Evaluate the model using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
5. Visualize the predictions against actual expenses.

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
- A well-trained **Linear Regression model** capable of predicting healthcare costs within **$3500 MAE**.
- A graphical representation comparing actual vs. predicted costs.
